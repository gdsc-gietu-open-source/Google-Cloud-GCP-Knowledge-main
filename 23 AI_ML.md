# AI & ML 

## ML_Engine
- Cloud ML_Engine , useful tool to train and deploy your machine learning models
- managed service for devlopers and data scientist to build their models
- Training and oline prediction, seamlessly deploy ML models into production - no docker container required

- ML is sub field of AI, goal of ML is to make computers learn from data that you give them.
- Instead writing code to tell PC to take action, your code provies an algorthi that adapts based on examples of intended behavior 
- resulting program, consisting of algorthim and associated learned parameter, known as Trained Model.


### Train an ML Model 
- Train Model
- Evaluate model accuracy
- Tune hyperparameter
- Deploy your trained model

### Send prediction request to your model
- Online prediction
- Batch prediction (only for Tensor Flow)
- Monitor the prediction on an ongoing basis
- Manage your models and model version.
