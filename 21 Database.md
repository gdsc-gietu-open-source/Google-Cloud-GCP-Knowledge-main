# Database
- Only few Database available (less than 5)
- Migrate , manage and modernize data with secure, reliable and higly available databases

### Why choose GCP for database
- flexible performance & scale 
- Broad Open source compatiblity
- Do more with data using ML/AI Integration

## Types of database supported

| Relational | NoSQL/Nonrelational | 
| :--------- | :------------------ | 
| CloudSpanner  : Cloud SQL | Cloud BigTable : Cloud Firestore : Firebase Realtime database : Cloud Memstore |

- Relational
  - CloudSpanner
  - CLoud SQL
- NoSQL/Non
  - BigTable
  - Firestore
  - Firebase Realtime 
  - Cloud Memstore

### SQL
- Fully compatible Relational database in the Cloud
- connects with any app built for MySQL, PostgreSQL & SQL Server
- Easy Integration with K8s, BigQuery and Compute Engine 
- Backup and security

### CloudSpanner
- Fully managed, Relational database , scalable, 
- First scalable, enterprise-grade
- globally distributed & strongly consistent
- combine benefit of Relational database structure with non-Relational horizontal scale.

---

### Cloud Bigtable 
- A petabyte-scale, fully managed NoSQL
- A single value in each row is indexed.
- Supports high read & write throughput at low latency
- ideal for MapReduce
BigQuery is an anylatic tool

### Memstore
- Redis provides fully-managed in-memory data store to build application caches provides sub-miliseconds data access.
- Deploy Basic Tier standalone Redis instance or Standard Tier high Avalailblity redis instance upto 300GB

### Cloud Firestore
- NoSQL document database built for  automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application
- same feature as traditional database, as a NoSQL database 
- differs, as describes Relatiionship between data object

### Firebase Realtime database
- store and sync data with our NoSQL Cloud database
- data is synced 
- using JSON
- like kenesis
