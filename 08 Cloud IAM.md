# IAM
- **Identity & Access Management**
- For granting fine-grained access control to resources within a project
- Gives ability to grant fine-grained access control to resources within a project 
- Allows compartmentalize access based on workgroups and to manage sensitive resources around individual access needs
- Simplicity
- Enterprise-grade ACL 
  - Unified view into security policy across entire organization
- Enterprise Identity made easy
  - Easily create or sync user accouns across application and Projects
  - Easy to provision and manage users and group,set up single sign-on (SSO) and configure Multi-factor authentication directly form your googel admin console
- Right roles
  - RR to manage resource permission with minimum fuss and high automation.
  - Map job function within ur compaany to group and role
- Granular resource control
- Context aware access
  - more Granular ACL to resources based on attributes like device security status, IP address, resource type and date/time.
- Built-in audit trail
- Access control your way
  - control permission using a variety of options: graphically from the cloud platform console,programatically via cloud IAM, or using the gcloud CLI 

# Concept
- GCP offers Cloud IAM , let you manage access control by defining WHO (identity) has WHAT access (role) for WHICH resource
- lets user adopt the security principle of least priviledge, so user grant only the necessary access to user resouce.
- This model for access management has three main parts
  1. Member
  2. Role 
  3. Policy

## 1. Identity Member Types
user grant access to members
- Google account
  - For developer, admins or any person with google ID 
- Service account
  - That belongs to your application instead of an individual end user 
- Google Group
  - Collection of Google accounts ands service accounts
  - Every group has unique email address
- G Suite Domain 
  - Represent a virtual group of all google account that have been created in an organization’s account
- Cloud Identity domain 
  - Its like G suite account but dont have access of G Suite application & features

### Cloud Identity Domain 
- all AuthenticatedUsers
  - Special identifier that represents anyone **who is authenticated with a Google account** or a service account 
  - Un-auth users are not not included
- allUsers
  - Anyone **who is on the internet** including auth & un-auth users
  - 
When an authenticated user attempted to access resource, cloud IAM checks Resource’s IAM policy to determine whether action is allowed.
- Resources
  - User can grant access to user for GCP resource.
  - Compute Engine Instance, storage
- Permisision
  - Determine what operations are allowed on resource.
  - Represented as <service>.<resource>.<verb>
  - pubsub.subscriptions.consume

## 2. Role 
- A role is collections of permission. 
- Cant be assigned to user directly

### Types of Cloud IAM Roles
- **Primitive roles**
  - Roles historically available in GCP console
  - Like Owner, editor , Browser and viewer
  
- **Predefined **
  - Give fine-grained access control than primitive roles.
  - Pub/sub publisher (roles/pubsub.publisher) provides access to only publish message to cloud pub/sub topic
  
- **Custom role**
  - Roles that you create to tailor permission to the needs of your organization

## 3. Policy
- Grant roles to users by creating a cloud IAM policy(collection of statements taht define who has what type of access)
- A policy is attached to a resource and is used to enforce access control  whenever that resource is accessed .
- GCP resources are organized hierarchically, where the organization node is the root node
- Projects are the children of the organization

## IAM Resource Hierarchy 
- The policy is set on a resource
- Each policy contains, set of roles, role member
- Resource inherit policies from parents
- Resource policies are a union of parent and resource
- If parent policy less restrictive, it overrides more restrictive resource policy
